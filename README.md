# Aerial Surveying in IIT Indore

Mentors: [Bhavya Dalal](https://github.com/dalalbhavya), [Raghuvamsi Bokka](https://github.com/RaghuvamsiBokka)

**Description:** IIT Indore has a considerable land area under
thick forest cover. In the blazing hot summers of Indore (as
we all have experienced), there are chances of bushes
catching fire and escalating to a forest fire. To prevent
it, an aerial surveying drone equipped with infrared cameras
and other sensors can be used to predict the areas which are
potential hotspots.

**Specifications:**
- Recognize abnormally high-temperature spots of the
forest cover to detect and signal the ground station
immediately.
- Identify high-risk areas that generally have higher
temperatures than average.
- Bonus Points for generalising the approach for
detecting animals (such as wild boar herds and
leopards) on our campus.
